For our HTML5 project, we are developing Parfumerie Vault, a perfume search website that helps users find perfumes based on their scent notes. To enhance user experience, we are integrating the following HTML5 features:

1. Animation

To create a luxurious and interactive browsing experience, we will use CSS animations & JavaScript effects:

Homepage Animation: White bubbles rising with a glitter effect.
Background Transition: Smooth image transitions for an elegant feel.
Interactive Hover Effects: Perfume cards will enlarge or change color when hovered.

2. Drag & Drop Functionality 

Users will be able to drag and drop elements for a more personalized experience:

Wishlist Creation: Drag perfumes into a wishlist.
Category Sorting: Rearrange perfume categories based on preference.

3. Geolocation 

To help users find perfume stores nearby, we will use the Geolocation API to:

Display perfume stores on an interactive map.
Allow users to filter stores by location.

4. Server-Sent Events (SSE) 

To provide real-time updates without refreshing the page, we will implement Server-Sent Events to:

Send live updates about new perfume arrivals & promotions.
Display notifications when new perfumes are added.
