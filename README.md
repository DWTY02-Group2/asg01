**Parfumerie Vault: HTML5 Features Integration**

Our HTML5 project, Parfumerie Vault, is a perfume search website designed to help users find perfumes based on their scent notes. To enhance the user experience, we are integrating the following HTML5 features:

### 1. Animation
To create a luxurious and interactive browsing experience, we will use CSS animations and JavaScript effects:

- **Floating Bubbles:** White bubbles will float around in the background to add a dreamy, elegant effect.
- **Gradient Background Transition:** A pastel-colored background will subtly transition through different gradients, creating a smooth, sophisticated ambiance.
- **Interactive Hover Effects:** Perfume cards will enlarge or change color when hovered, making the browsing experience more engaging.

### 2. Drag & Drop Functionality
To provide a more interactive and organized user experience, we will implement drag-and-drop features:

- **Wishlist Creation:** Users can drag perfumes into the wishlist box, where the item will be **duplicated** instead of removed from its original position.
- **Item Adjustment:** Once placed in the wishlist, the perfume will **shrink in size** to prevent overlapping and ensure a neat arrangement.
- **Easy Removal:** Users can remove a perfume from the wishlist by simply clicking on it, leaving the other items intact.

### 3. Geolocation
To help users find perfume stores nearby, we will integrate the Geolocation API to:

- **Display perfume stores on an interactive map.**
- **Allow users to filter stores by location,** making it easier to find nearby stores.

### 4. Server-Sent Events (SSE)
To provide real-time updates without requiring users to refresh the page, we will implement Server-Sent Events:

- **Live Updates:** Users will receive real-time notifications about new perfume arrivals and promotions.
- **Instant Notifications:** Updates will be displayed dynamically when new perfumes are added to the database.

### 5. Navigation Bar Behavior
For better usability, we are adding an intuitive navigation bar with dynamic visibility:

- **Auto-Hide Feature:** The navigation bar will disappear when users scroll downward for a distraction-free experience.
- **Reappear on Scroll Up:** When scrolling upwards, the navigation bar will reappear, ensuring easy access to website sections.

These features aim to make Parfumerie Vault a seamless and enjoyable platform for users searching for the perfect scent.
